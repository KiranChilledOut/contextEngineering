**$10 Million Longitude Prize Launched to Accelerate ALS Drug Discovery**  
A new global challenge, the Longitude Prize on ALS, has been launched with a $10 million fund to incentivize AI-driven innovations in drug discovery for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common motor neuron disease. This initiative aims to transform treatment approaches using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and was announced at the Bio-IT World Conference & Expo[1].

**UK Biobank Completes World's Largest Whole Body Imaging Project**  
UK Biobank has finalized the scanning of 100,000 volunteersâ€™ brains, hearts, abdomens, blood vessels, bones, and joints, creating the largest whole body imaging dataset ever. This vast repository, soon accessible to approved researchers, contains over one billion de-identified images and is expected to accelerate research into diseases like heart disease, dementia, and cancer by enabling better diagnostic tools[1].

**AI Uncovers Greater Scale and Diversity in Carbon Dioxide Removal Research**  
A recent study employing advanced AI and natural language processing has revealed that the scientific literature on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is far more extensive and varied than previously recognized. By systematically mapping thousands of publications across disciplines, this research offers a comprehensive and dynamic overview of CDR strategies, highlighting new connections and underexplored areas critical for climate change mitigation[2].

**Breakthrough in Solar Energy: Durable Perovskite Solar Cells for Humid Environments**  
Researchers at the Korea Institute of Materials Science have developed a highly durable flexible perovskite solar cell that maintains stability in humidity levels up to 50%. This innovation overcomes a major barrier in solar technology by enabling efficient solar cell production in normal atmospheric conditions without costly controlled environments, potentially accelerating commercial adoption of perovskite solar cells[3].

**Immersive Virtual Reality Nature Scenes Show Promise for Pain Relief**  
A study from the University of Exeter demonstrates that immersive VR experiences of natural environments like forests and waterfalls can significantly reduce pain sensitivity, nearly matching the effectiveness of medication. Brain imaging confirmed activation of pain-modulating pathways, suggesting VR nature scenes could become a novel, non-pharmacological approach to pain management[4].
