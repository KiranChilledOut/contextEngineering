The International Monetary Fund (IMF) updated its World Economic Outlook, projecting global GDP growth at 3.0% for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026, slightly higher than previous estimates. This revision is attributed to reduced trade-related distortions, improved financial conditions, and fiscal stimulus in key economies.

Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase is nearing a deal to take over Appleâ€™s credit-card program, signaling consolidation in financial technology services[1].
