**1. White-Basilisk AI Model Revolutionizes Software Vulnerability Detection**  
A new AI model named White-Basilisk has been developed to detect software vulnerabilities more efficiently than much larger AI systems. With only 200 million parameters, it outperforms models 30 times its size by analyzing extremely long code sequences (up to 128,000 tokens), enabling it to detect vulnerabilities spanning multiple files or functions. This breakthrough challenges the notion that bigger models are always better, especially for specialized tasks like cybersecurity. The model’s compactness also means it is more energy-efficient and practical for real-world applications.

**2. White House AI Action Plan Highlights Innovation but Overlooks AGI Risks**  
The U.S. White House released its "AI Action Plan" focusing on accelerating AI innovation, infrastructure, and international cooperation. However, experts criticize the plan for not addressing the urgent need to understand and prepare for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Superintelligence, and the "Black Box" problem—where AI decision-making processes are opaque and unpredictable. The plan calls for breakthroughs in AI interpretability and robustness but lacks a comprehensive strategy for the risks posed by advanced AI beyond current LLMs.
